term,definition
Quadratic equation,An equation like x² + 5x + 6 = 0 — forms a parabola
Factorization (quadratics),Breaking down: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
Simultaneous equations,Two equations solved together: x + y = 5, 2x - y = 4
Inequalities with graphs,Shading regions on a graph where inequalities are true
Gradient of a line,m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) — rise over run
Equation of a line,y = mx + c — m is gradient, c is y-intercept
Distance between points,Use Pythagoras: √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]
Midpoint of a line,( (x₁+x₂)/2 , (y₁+y₂)/2 )
Trigonometry,Study of triangles — sin, cos, tan
Sine (sin),Opposite / Hypotenuse
Cosine (cos),Adjacent / Hypotenuse
Tangent (tan),Opposite / Adjacent
Angle of elevation,Angle above horizontal — looking up
Angle of depression,Angle below horizontal — looking down
Area of sector,(θ/360) × πr² — for a slice of circle
