# GRADE 4: SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

## 1. Living and Non-Living Things
- **Living things**: Grow, breathe, move, reproduce (e.g., plants, animals)
- **Non-living things**: Do not grow or breathe (e.g., rock, water, chair)

## 2. Parts of a Plant
- **Roots**: Hold plant in soil, absorb water
- **Stem**: Carries water and food
- **Leaves**: Make food using sunlight (photosynthesis)
- **Flower**: Makes seeds
- **Fruit**: Protects seeds

## 3. Photosynthesis
- How plants make food.
- Needs: Sunlight + Water + Carbon Dioxide → Food (glucose) + Oxygen

## 4. Human Body Systems
- **Skeletal System**: Bones – support and protect
- **Muscular System**: Muscles – help move
- **Digestive System**: Stomach, intestines – break down food
- **Respiratory System**: Lungs – breathe in oxygen

## 5. States of Matter
- **Solid**: Fixed shape (e.g., ice, wood)
- **Liquid**: Takes shape of container (e.g., water, milk)
- **Gas**: No fixed shape (e.g., air, steam)

## 6. Energy
- **Solar energy**: From the sun
- **Electrical energy**: From batteries or power
- **Sound energy**: From voices, drums
- **Heat energy**: From fire, sun

## 7. Simple Machines
- **Lever**: A bar that lifts things (e.g., seesaw)
- **Pulley**: Wheel with rope (e.g., flagpole)
- **Inclined plane**: Ramp – makes moving easier
- **Wheel and axle**: Wheel turns around a rod (e.g., bicycle)

## 8. Environment
- **Pollution**: Harmful substances in air, water, or land
- **Recycling**: Using materials again (paper, plastic, glass)
- **Conservation**: Protecting nature

## 9. Weather
- **Sunny**: Bright sky
- **Rainy**: Water falls from clouds
- **Windy**: Air moves fast
- **Cloudy**: Sky covered with clouds

## 10. Technology
- **Computer**: Machine that stores and processes information
- **Keyboard**: Type words
- **Mouse**: Move cursor
- **Monitor**: Shows what the computer is doing
