# GRADE 9: INTEGRATED SCIENCE

## 1. Photosynthesis
- Process by which green plants make food using sunlight.
- Word equation:
  Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen
- Needs: Chlorophyll, sunlight, CO₂, water
- Takes place in leaves

## 2. Respiration
- Process that releases energy from food.
- Word equation:
  Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy
- Happens in all living cells — day and night

## 3. Photosynthesis vs Respiration
| Photosynthesis | Respiration |
|----------------|-------------|
| Makes food | Releases energy |
| Needs sunlight | Happens all the time |
| Takes in CO₂ | Releases CO₂ |
| Releases O₂ | Takes in O₂ |

## 4. Ecosystems
- A community of living organisms interacting with non-living environment.
- **Biotic factors**: Living things (plants, animals)
- **Abiotic factors**: Non-living (sunlight, water, soil)

## 5. Food Webs
- Many food chains linked together.
- Shows energy flow: Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk

## 6. Decomposers
- Organisms that break down dead matter (bacteria, fungi)
- Return nutrients to soil

## 7. Nitrogen Cycle
1. **Nitrogen fixation**: Bacteria convert air nitrogen to nitrates
2. **Nitrification**: Ammonia → Nitrites → Nitrates
3. **Denitrification**: Nitrates → Nitrogen gas (back to air)

## 8. Water Cycle
1. **Evaporation**: Water → Water vapor (from sun)
2. **Condensation**: Vapor → Clouds
3. **Precipitation**: Rain, snow, hail
4. **Collection**: Rivers, lakes, groundwater

## 9. Climate Change
- Long-term change in weather patterns
- Caused by:
  - Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil)
  - Deforestation
  - Greenhouse gases (CO₂, methane)
- Effects: Droughts, floods, rising sea levels

## 10. Conservation & Sustainability
- **Conservation**: Protecting natural resources
- **Sustainability**: Using resources without harming future generations
- Ways: Recycling, tree planting, renewable energy
